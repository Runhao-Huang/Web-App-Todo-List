# Web-App-Todo-List
This is a todolist web app launching on heroku server, using mongoDB-Altas as Backend database. I used node.js, ejs, express, html, css as Frontend languages. Website: https://secure-bastion-71640.herokuapp.com/

You could also launch it on local host. Please make sure to use npm i in your command line before loading this web-app on localhost:3000
